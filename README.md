# XonoVR
A VR standart compatible with SteamVR made for tinkerers.
# Credits
Liquid for creating [HadesVR](https://github.com/HadesVR) and HadesVR Driver.

Externet for creating [PSMoveServiceEx](https://github.com/Timocop/PSMoveServiceEx).
# Driver
(From [HadesVR Readme.md](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR?tab=readme-ov-file))
The SteamVR driver used to be based off of [TrueOpenVR](https://github.com/TrueOpenVR) but it's modified so heavily I'm making it it's own thing. This driver also uses [PSMoveServiceEX](https://github.com/Timocop/PSMoveServiceEx) (for now at least) for the positional tracking of HMD and controllers, using ping pong balls and different colours of LED's.
# Devices
I'm planning to make controllers and hmd based of [HadesVR](https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR) and [FloV3R](https://github.com/Kwiatens/FloV3R)
# PCBs and 3D printing
There is no files for PCB or 3D Printing for now
